## Abstract

<p align="justify"> The existing centralized infrastructure of the energy market doesn’t hold enough potential to cope with the dynamics of the decentralized energy system with a huge volume of renewables and market participants. Secure and transparent data aggregation and access to the data are also among top concerns of regulatory authorities. With an open, GISbased, web3 energy browser market participants from different backgrounds would have a transparent view on the static and dynamic properties of the energy system to find potentials for increasing the overall efficiency of all the participants.</p>

<p align="justify"> The current project is aimed to develop a web3 based energy Geo browser having a spatial distribution of renewable energy sources with a simple use case on top of Ethereum blockchain backend. The thesis will describe a vertical slice to evaluate current potentials, issues, and limitations concerning blockchain technology in the energy sector with a strong focus on energy certification.</p>
